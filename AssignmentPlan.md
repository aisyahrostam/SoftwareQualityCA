## Assignment Plan

1. Aimee Yourell will be working on the Coding Standards
2. Aisyah Rostam will be working on Code Reviews
3. Ciaran Dawson will be working on Task estimation in Scrum

Our plan for this assignment is to work on our own headings independtly, and then work together to get the conclusions completed and also to reread other peoples work and try to fix any issues which we may notice.

When it comes to Github, our plan is to commit our work every 30 mins and to push our work once it is completed and ready to be reviewed by another team member before merging the work together. Also if another team member is stuck or confused with regards to Github, then the team will work together to guide that individual.

Lastly, we will come together before submitting the assignment to ensure all team members are happy with the work which we have completed and we will also do one more quick run through of the assignment to ensure that there are no spelling or grammar mistakes.
