# Task Estimation in Scrum
Task Estimation plays an important role in the iterative development of products following a product backlog. 
In Task Estimation, User Stories are approved by the Product Owner for the Spint. Each User Story is then analysed by the Scrum Team to estimate the required effort to complete them.

 Here we will discuss some of the multiple ways we might appoach Task Estimation, such as:
 1. Planning Poker
 2. T-Shirt Sizes
 3. The Bucket System
 4. Doting Voting
 5. Big/Uncertain/Small
 
## Planning Poker
The **Planning Poker Technique** involes an agreement from the Scrum Team on the estimations of the User Stories while ensuring everbody has a say. Everybody is given a set of cards with numbers of the Fibonacci sequence on them. The higher the value, the higher the task estimation. When everybody is ready, each team member chooses a card to submit and explains their reasoning, and using the combined perspective of the team, the estimation is agreed upon.

This is great for ensuring everybody has a comprehensive understanding of the required work and allowing the team members to express any concerns or doubts they have. However, many find it to be a time consuming process, with people often struggling to reach an agreement in estimation size. The original creator, James Grenning, expressed that you shouldn't spend too much time reaching an agreement, however this often isn't the case.



## T-Shirt Sizes
The **T-Shirt Sizes Technique** is intended when estimating a large backlog of items to give a more rough estimate of effort. T-shirt Sizing is about grouping together items of similar size. The size is usually given the same label a t-shirt might have such as extra small, small, medium, large, and extra-large.

While T-Shirt Sizing can be used to estimate task very quickly and is easy for the team to understand, it does have it's problems as rough estimates can be agreed too quickly and if a deadline cannot be met the team cannot be held accountable as the estitmates are vague.
