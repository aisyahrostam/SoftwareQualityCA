# Task Estimation in Scrum
Task Estimation plays an important role in the iterative development of products following a product backlog. 
In Task Estimation, User Stories are approved by the Product Owner for the Spint. Each User Story is then analysed by the Scrum Team to estimate the required effort to complete them.

 Here we will discuss some of the multiple ways we might appoach Task Estimation, such as:
 1. Planning Poker
 2. T-Shirt Sizes
 3. The Bucket System
 4. Doting Voting
 5. Big/Uncertain/Small
