#Coding Standards

Coding standards are a set of rules, guidelines and best practises for coding. They make sure that the software is:
1. Secure - It is safe to use
2. Protected - It is impossible to break into
3. Trustworthy - It does what it is supposed to do
4. Sustainable - It is possible to test it at the code level
5. Maintainable - Even as your codebase expands, it can be maintained
6. Convient - In every situation, it operates the same way

#Why are coding standards important?

Coding standards are signigficant because they aid in the assurance of safety, security and stability. Coding standards should be used by all development teams. Even the most skilled programmer can make a coding error without even realising it, and unfortunately that one flaw could cause a tiny hiccup, or even worse a significant security violation. Simply put, if coding standards are not set, developers may use any way they like, which may have undesirable consequences such as:

1. Security Issues
If software is inconsistent, including defects, or has logic faults, it becomes vulnerable to assaults. The majority of the aformentioned issues are caused by improper programming, which may have occured as a result of bad coding techniques.

2. Performance Problems
Poor coding has a negative impact on the system usability. The performance difficulties include a variety of aspects such as how the user interacts with the system, server response issues, code reusability and flow, and so on. These challenges can be readily solved when software code standards are applied, resulting in a secure system with minimal or no speed issues.

#What are the advantages of implementing coding standards?

1. Increased Productivity
Developers frequently invest a significant amount of time correcting code quality issues which might have been avoided. Programming standards and practice guidelines would assit the team in detecting and preventing problems early on. This will improve the software developement process' productivity.


2. The likelihood of a project's failure is decreased
IT initiatives frequently fail as a result of issues encountered while developing software. Many problems and the likelihood of project failure are reduced when code guidelines are followed.

3. Minimising Complexity
When a code is complicated, it is more likely to fall victim to bugs. Coding standards assit in the construction of less complicated software programs, which reduces bugs.

#How can you following coding standards?

1. Comments in the code and code documentation
When developing code, it is a good idea to leave comments. It aids in the comprehension of your code by other engineers. Every method should begin with a remark describing what the method or function does, as well as its different parameters, return values and flaws. In addition, the comments should explain the function of each the files and also the classes. However even though it is important to include comments in your code, please avoid commenting on obvious pieces of code. GIVE DIAGRAMS HERE

2. Ensuring consistent name schemes
There are two very popular naming schemes which developers usually follow:
1. CamelCase - this is a name convention which does not capatise the first letter of the word however it does capalise the second second of the word.
2. Underscore - using an underscore to seperate two words

It really is up to the programmer to decide on which naming strategy they would like to use, however it is critucal that the naming scheme remains consistent thtough the code

3. Nesting structures with a lot of depth should be minimised
The code can be really hard to understand if there are too many nesting structures involved, as a result, deeping nesting should be avoided wherever possible

4. Refactor the code
Refacoring is done to help improve the readability of the code without ever effecting the main functionailities of the code
