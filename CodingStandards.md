#Coding Standards

Coding standards are a set of rules, guidelines and best practises for coding. They make sure that the software is:
1. Secure - It is safe to use
2. Protected - It is impossible to break into
3. Trustworthy - It does what it is supposed to do
4. Sustainable - It is possible to test it at the code level
5. Maintainable - Even as your codebase expands, it can be maintained
6. Convient - In every situation, it operates the same way

#Why are coding standards important?

Coding standards are signigficant because they aid in the assurance of safety, security and stability. Coding standards should be used by all development teams. Even the most skilled programmer can make a coding error without even realising it, and unfortunately that one flaw could cause a tiny hiccup, or even worse a significant security violation. Simply put, if coding standards are not set, developers may use any way they like, which may have undesirable consequences such as:

1. Security Issues
If software is inconsistent, including defects, or has logic faults, it becomes vulnerable to assaults. The majority of the aformentioned issues are caused by improper programming, which may have occured as a result of bad coding techniques.

2. Performance Problems
Poor coding has a negative impact on the system usability. The performance difficulties include a variety of aspects such as how the user interacts with the system, server response issues, code reusability and flow, and so on. These challenges can be readily solved when software code standards are applied, resulting in a secure system with minimal or no speed issues.
