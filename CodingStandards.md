#Coding Standards

Coding standards are a set of rules, guidelines and best practises for coding. They make sure that the software is:
1. Secure - It is safe to use
2. Protected - It is impossible to break into
3. Trustworthy - It does what it is supposed to do
4. Sustainable - It is possible to test it at the code level
5. Maintainable - Even as your codebase expands, it can be maintained
6. Convenient  - In every situation, it operates the same way

#Why are coding standards important?

Coding standards are significant because they aid in the assurance of safety, security and stability. Coding standards should be used by all development teams. Even the most skilled programmer can make a coding error without even realising it, and unfortunately that one flaw could cause a tiny hiccup, or even worse a significant security violation. Simply put, if coding standards are not set, developers may use any way they like, which may have undesirable consequences such as:

1. Security Issues
If software is inconsistent, including defects, or has logic faults, it becomes vulnerable to assaults. The majority of the aforementioned issues are caused by improper programming, which may have occurred as a result of bad coding techniques.

2. Performance Problems
Poor coding has a negative impact on the system usability. The performance difficulties include a variety of aspects such as how the user interacts with the system, server response issues, code reusability and flow, and so on. These challenges can be readily solved when software code standards are applied, resulting in a secure system with minimal or no speed issues.

For example Epic Games are a leading interactive gaming company which provide 3D engine technology. Epic Games follow some simple coding standards which has helped the company to stay productive and to use their time wisely. Here we will discuss a few of their coding standards which they follow. Firstly, any file which is provided by Epic must contain a copy right notice on the first line of every file, which is provided by the company. When it comes to naming conventions, all code and comments must be written in American English. The first letter of every word must be capitalised, boolean words must begin with a small letter b followed by a capital, variable names must only be noun words and lastly methods must be words which are verbs which describe the class. Finally, Comments must be clear and short. Comment must not be negative such as how the method does not work correctly, if a programmer writes a negative comment, they must remove it and correct the bugs which are causing the method to not work correctly.

#What are the advantages of implementing coding standards?

1. Increased Productivity
Developers frequently invest a significant amount of time correcting code quality issues which might have been avoided. Programming standards and practice guidelines would assist the team in detecting and preventing problems early on. This will improve the software development process' productivity.


2. The likelihood of a project's failure is decreased
IT initiatives frequently fail as a result of issues encountered while developing software. Many problems and the likelihood of project failure are reduced when code guidelines are followed.

3. Minimising Complexity
When a code is complicated, it is more likely to fall victim to bugs. Coding standards assist in the construction of less complicated software programs, which reduces bugs.

SAP, offer coding standard recommendations online for their customers to follow. These guidelines are in place to guarantee that developers follow a set of established guidelines when performing anything. With SAP Commerce Cloud, the code can be structured in a variety of different ways, however if there are no guidelines in place, it will make managing the code a lot harder, and this can affect the process of trying to recruit new programmers on the team. But by setting these guidelines at the start of the project and ensuring that they are understood by all and followed, this will lean towards reducing coding errors. 
SAP offer advice on naming conventions, they follow CamelCase scheme. Class names must begin with a capital letter and each word that follows must also be a capital, method names must begin with a small letter followed by upper for the next word, this is the same for the variable names. Classes should end with "Service' or "Facade", which helps determine the type of class. There should be comments throughout the code explaining what methods are doing and what is their purpose. As you can see, coding standards are very important for every company big or small, and using these coding standards can help with a companies overall performance. 


#How can you following coding standards?

1. Comments in the code and code documentation
When developing code, it is a good idea to leave comments. It aids in the comprehension of your code by other engineers. Every method should begin with a remark describing what the method or function does, as well as its different parameters, return values and flaws. In addition, the comments should explain the function of each the files and also the classes. However even though it is important to include comments in your code, please avoid commenting on obvious pieces of code. GIVE DIAGRAMS HERE

2. Ensuring consistent name schemes
There are two very popular naming schemes which developers usually follow:
1. CamelCase - this is a name convention which does not capitalise the first letter of the word however it does capitalise the second of the word.
2. Underscore - using an underscore to separate two words

It really is up to the programmer to decide on which naming strategy they would like to use, however it is critical that the naming scheme remains consistent through the code

3. Nesting structures with a lot of depth should be minimised
The code can be really hard to understand if there are too many nesting structures involved, as a result, deep nesting should be avoided wherever possible

4. Refactor the code
Refactoring is done to help improve the readability of the code without ever effecting the main functionalities of the code
