Coding standards are a set of rules, guidelines and best practises for coding. They make sure that the software is:
1. Secure - It is safe to use
2. Protected - It is impossible to break into
3. Trustworthy - It does what it is supposed to do
4. Sustainable - It is possible to test it at the code level
5. Maintainable - Even as your codebase expands, it can be maintained
6. Convient - In every situation, it operates the same way
