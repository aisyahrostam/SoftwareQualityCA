## Introduction

This handbook will explain three main topics, which all companies need to follow in order to reduce failures, reduce time wasted and also improve the overall performance of a company. The topics include:
1. Task estimation in Scrum
2. Coding Standards
3. Code Reviews

The handbook will talk about each topic in great detail, explaining exactly what each topic means, the advantages of following these guidelines and examples of companies who also have these guidelines implemented into their company. It will also discuss how the company can implement these guidelines into their everyday working life and finally what are the implications if these guidelines are not followed. 

I strongly recommend each member to carefully read this handbook, and then as a team discuss what you have learned. It is important as a company to come up with your own guidelines which must be followed by all, this will help improve the company and will lead to more successful projects in the future.
