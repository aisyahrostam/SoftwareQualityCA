#Coding Review

Code review is a process that ensures the completed code by a developer is of good quality and delivers on the expected requirements. The code is inspected by one or a group of developers who are experts in that specific programming language. The reviewer highlights mistakes, bugs, improves the code quality and provides a second opinion on the logic being used.
