#Coding Review

Code review is a process that ensures the completed code by a developer is of good quality and delivers on the expected requirements. The code is inspected by one or a group of developers who are experts in that specific programming language. The reviewer highlights mistakes, bugs, improves the code quality and provides a second opinion on the logic being used.



#Advantages of Code Reviews

1. Increase code quality
Code reviewing is vital because it helps developers identify existing bugs and architectural mistakes in the early stages of the software development. These reviews also increase the code quality by ensuring that it is readable, reliable, maintainable, portable, reusable and testable.

2. Learning
Reviewing code is a great way for reviewers and reviewees to develop their coding skills and knowledge. Both benefit from the process, the reviewee can improve the quality and efficiency of their coding through constructive feedback and recommendations from the reviewer. Likewise, the reviewer may find new approaches or techniques when questioning or solving errors .

3. Compliance
Every developer has a distinct coding style depending on the way they were taught and trained. When working on team projects, where multiple developers contribute to the code it is important that each member follows the same standard coding style to achieve a clean code. Code review is a great way to achieve this throughout the project. 

4. Exchange knowledge 
Code review is a practical and productive way for Software developers to share their coding knowledge and skills with each other through feedback and changes made during code reviews. For example, junior developers can learn a lot from their more senior colleagues. This is important in organisations, to make sure all developers, junior and seniors alike, become familiar with any company specific coding knowledge or evolving concepts and topics. This ensures continuity and prevents weak points in the team.
