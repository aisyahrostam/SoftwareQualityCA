#Coding Review

Code review is a process that ensures the completed code by a developer is of good quality and delivers on the expected requirements. The code is inspected by one or a group of developers who are experts in that specific programming language. The reviewer highlights mistakes, bugs, improves the code quality and provides a second opinion on the logic being used.



#Advantages of Code Reviews

1. Increase code quality
Code reviewing is vital because it helps developers identify existing bugs and architectural mistakes in the early stages of the software development. These reviews also increase the code quality by ensuring that it is readable, reliable, maintainable, portable, reusable and testable.

2. Learning
Reviewing code is a great way for reviewers and reviewees to develop their coding skills and knowledge. Both benefit from the process, the reviewee can improve the quality and efficiency of their coding through constructive feedback and recommendations from the reviewer. Likewise, the reviewer may find new approaches or techniques when questioning or solving errors .

3. Compliance
Every developer has a distinct coding style depending on the way they were taught and trained. When working on team projects, where multiple developers contribute to the code it is important that each member follows the same standard coding style to achieve a clean code. Code review is a great way to achieve this throughout the project. 

4. Exchange knowledge 
Code review is a practical and productive way for Software developers to share their coding knowledge and skills with each other through feedback and changes made during code reviews. For example, junior developers can learn a lot from their more senior colleagues. This is important in organisations, to make sure all developers, junior and seniors alike, become familiar with any company specific coding knowledge or evolving concepts and topics. This ensures continuity and prevents weak points in the team.



#Types of Code Reviews
 
1. Instant Code Review - This type of code review procedure is also known as Pair Programming, where two developers code and review at the same time. It is crucial that both developers have comparable coding skills and knowledge especially when working on a complex project as it will speed up the development process and increase the possibility of getting the code to work properly. It also allows you to see different standpoints and one developer can make up for where the other lacks.
 
2. Synchronous Code Review - This process is also called "Over the shoulder code review", where the reviewee independently works on a task. Only once they are finished then do they thoroughly explain their code to the reviewer. At the same time, the reviewer is inspecting the code and brainstorming different ways to improve the code along with the reviewee. This type of code review is ideal for when the reviewer is unaware of the goals of the task since a full explanation will be given by the reviewee. It is also suitable for scenarios where a junior developer is implementing a code and a senior developer is reviewing. 
 
3. Asynchronous Code review - This type of review is also called a "Tool-assisted code review". During this process, the coder and the reviewer work on the code at separate times. The coder will first complete a coding task on his own and then allow the completed code to be inspected by the reviewer. The reviewer examines the work whenever they're free and will provide constructive comments on necessary changes using a tool. Once the review is finished, the tool will inform the coder of the comments left by the reviewer. The coder follows up by performing the changes advised to improve the code quality. The perk of this approach is that both the coder and reviewer can perform their duty whenever they are available. However, this may be more suitable for projects with longer deadlines.
 
4. Meeting based code review - This procedure is also known as "Once in a while review", where occasionally during a meeting the whole team is given a rundown and explanation of the code by the developer. The team members will then examine the code to highlight potential problems, provide feedback and offer recommendations to improve the code. This type of review is not common, typically only done when the team is not familiar with code reviews. 



#Best practices for Code Review

1. Prepare a checklist for Code Review
Before performing a code review, make sure to prepare a checklist of areas to examine such as code structure, logic, performance and readability etc. This will help you concentrate and make the process more time-efficient.
 
2. Build and Test code
Ahead of the code review, you should run tests on the code for errors. This will help reduce the time spent on the review.
 
3. 60 minutes Code review session
For better concentration, you should split code reviews into multiple sessions. Each session should not last longer than 60 minutes. 
  
4. 400 Lines each review session
To ensure the most satisfactory results, you should limit each review to only 400 lines of code or less.  
 
5. Constructive feedback
When reviewing codes, make sure to provide encouraging and valuable comments on how to improve the quality of the code. Avoid giving harsh and critical feedback.
